Current project is a todo list using online Tutorials as a bases for me to learn the Language.
My end goal is to become #GoogleCertified
Because I like pieces of paper I can put on the wall.

However this todo list is apart of a scheduling / time management suite as I don't know how I could go about finding one that suits my needs.
If it gets to a "basically complete" stage I will more than likely publish it to an online store for either free or low cost.
